# Book sharing system

This project is a platform that enables a person-to-person book sharing system. A person-to-person book sharing system is a decentralized and collaborative approach to sharing books among individuals directly, without the involvement of centralized institutions like libraries.

It aims to facilitate book sharing among users, allowing them to lend and borrow books from one another. Users can create profiles, list their books and request books from others. Users can also review the books they have borrowed and give a rating to the user from whom they borrowed.
